<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>After all these years I finally said, "Hello World." And here I thought this was some back door to the Matrix. Nope...127.0.0.1 maybe?
  Nah...But I do now own http://127zz.one. My hacked version of 127.0.0.1. This domain non-property ownership is too much for a career squirrel.
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
